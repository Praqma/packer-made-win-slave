Create a file called jenkins.txt and place it to this directory
This file should contain 3 lines - jenkins master url to connect to, username, passord. Every piece on the new line. Example

  > cat jenkins.txt
  https://...../jenkins
  jenkins
  mysuperpassw0rd!

Make sure that password contains letters, digits and symbols - login and password will be used to create a local Windows user and Windows is picky when it comes to passwords
